This is a githib repository (technically a fork)
of Rrdrand, taken from
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Rrdrand/

It is archived and not available on live CRAN because of test errors which are noted here:

https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2023/2023-01-26_check_results_Rrdrand.html

These do not affect x86_64 architecture using gcc, so on that platform it will install fine.
